    m_Localized: 2051, Despite numerous warnings from scientific experts and alarming
      reports from the IPCC over the past decades, the measures taken to combat climate
      changes are insufficient.  Natural disasters, wars and virus epidemics have
      increased. Melting ice is causing the waters to rise, making many parts of
      the world inhospitable. With the help of the largest multinationals, the governments
      of many countries have organised the colonisation of the planet Mars to save
      humanity, mission is called EMR (Earth to Mars Rescue).
